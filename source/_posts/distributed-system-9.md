## Mutual Exclusion

### Ricart-Agrawala’s Algorithm

- `enter()` at process Pi
  - set state to *Wanted*
  - multicast *“Request”* $<T_i, P_i>$ to all processes
    where $T_i =$ current Lamport timestamp at $P_i$
  - wait until all processes send back *“Reply”*
  - change state to *Held* and enter the CS
- On receipt of a Request $<T_j, P_j>$ at $P_i$ ($i \ne j$):
  - if (state = *Held*) or (state = *Wanted* and $(T_i, i) < (T_j, j)$) *// lexicographic ordering in $(T_j, P_j)$*
    - add request to local queue (of waiting requests)
  - else send *“Reply”* to $P_j$
- `exit()` at process Pi
  - change state to Released and *“Reply”* to all queued requests.

### Maekawa’s Algorithm

put $N$ processes in a $\sqrt{N}$ by $\sqrt{N}$ matrix and for each $P_i$, its voting set $V_i =$ row containing $P_i$ + column containing $P_i$ (each set size = $2\sqrt{N}-1$)

_voting set_

- state = *Released*, voted = *false*
- `enter()` at process Pi:
  - state = *Wanted*
  - Multicast *Request* message to all processes in $V_i$
  - Wait for *Reply (vote)* messages from all processes in $V_i$ (including vote from self)
  - state = *Held*
- `exit()` at process Pi:
  - state = *Released*
  - Multicast *Release* to all processes in $V_i$:
- When $P_i$ receives a Request from $P_j$:
  - if (state $==$ *Held* OR voted $==$ *true*)
    - queue Request
  - else
    - send Reply to $P_j$ and set voted $=$ *true*
- When $P_i$ receives a *Release* from $P_j$:
  - if (queue empty)
    - voted $=$ *false*
  - else
    - dequeue head of queue as $P_k$
    - Send *Reply* only to $P_k$
    - voted = *true*
