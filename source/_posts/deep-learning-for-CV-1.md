## Detailed Topics

### Taxonomy of Learning Problems

- **Type of Output:** Different tasks require different outputs, ranging from simple classifications to complex structured predictions.
- **Type of Supervision:** Covers the spectrum from fully supervised learning, where every piece of training data is labeled, to unsupervised learning, where no labels are provided.
- **Training Regime:** Discusses the methodologies for training models, including batch and online learning, and introduces concepts like active and reinforcement learning.

### Learning Approaches

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Explores clustering, dimensionality reduction, and learning the data distribution through methods like GANs and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).
- **Self-supervised Learning:** Utilizes part of the data to predict other parts, with applications in image colorization, future prediction, and grasp prediction.

### Modern Trends

- **Data Engines:** Describes the evolution of data processing models, highlighting the transition from manual to semi-automatic and fully automatic stages, exemplified by tasks like promptable segmentation.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Focuses on agents learning to interact with the world through actions, with examples including DeepMindâ€™s AlphaGo and sensorimotor learning for locomotion in challenging terrains.
