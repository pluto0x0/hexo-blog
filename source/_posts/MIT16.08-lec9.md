# Independent

no combination give a zero vector (expect $0$).

If columns of $A$ are independent, $N(A) = {0}$.

# Span

vectors span a space means the space consists of all combinations of those vectors.

# Basis

Basis for a space is vectors with 2 properties:

- They are independent.
- They span the pace.

Every basis of the space have the same number of vectors. i.e. the **dimension.**

$\dim N(A) = n-rank(A)$
